# 📧 Spam vs. Ham Email Classifier

### Overview
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify text messages as either "Spam" or "Ham" (Legitimate). It demonstrates how to handle unstructured text data and convert it into a format machine learning models can understand.

### 🔧 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas
* **Algorithm:** Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
* **Feature Extraction:** CountVectorizer (Bag of Words)

### 📊 Results
* **Accuracy:** ~98%
* **Capabilities:** Can successfully flag new, unseen spam messages (like fake lottery wins or urgent requests).

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in this repository.
2. Run the cells to train the model on the dataset.
3. Use the "Bonus Test" section at the bottom to input your own custom sentences and test the filter!
